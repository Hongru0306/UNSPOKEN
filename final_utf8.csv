Therefore, this kind of address held by default and had no actual selective significance. The deeper meaning lies in that parents use this strategy to avoid directly answering who their favorite child is, thereby maintaining family harmony, but it exposes the emptiness of this response. Steve's intervention added to the humor. He affirmed that the parents' approach was ""the right way"" and speculated that Sarah, as the older child, might feel that Adam is more favored because the second child is usually treated more leniently.

The assumption of serious marital problems is based on the perception that sharing a bed is a common norm in marriages, and any deviation from it, like sleeping separately, could potentially lead to or be a symptom of deeper relationship troubles.
(B).The speaker’s friends believe that sleeping in separate rooms is a sign of a failing marriage.
(C). Norma, on the other hand, has found that the separate - room sleeping arrangement has several benefits for their relationship. Since they started sleeping separately after her husband had the flu, they discovered that they both slept better in their own beds. Additionally, considering her being a night - person and her husband being an early - riser, this arrangement helps accommodate their different sleep schedules. Moreover, she emphasizes that their sex life remains great, and they still spend quality time together at night, indicating that the sleeping arrangement hasn't negatively impacted their relationship in these important aspects.

(E). Contrary to what one might expect, Norma's friends are not supportive of her decision to sleep separately from her husband. Instead, they are quick to label it as a terrible thing and a bad sign for her marriage.

(F). Far from being universally accepted as a healthy practice in marriages, the idea of sleeping in separate rooms is often met with skepticism, as seen through the reaction of Norma's friends. The general consensus in society, as reflected by her friends' views, is that sharing a bed is an important aspect of a married couple's relationship.

Society often expects individuals, especially women, to maintain a sense of independence and self-sufficiency as they grow older. The speaker's dilemma humorously highlights the tension between these expectations and the practical need for financial stability.

(B) In contrast to her state of indecision, this option posits that the woman is completely certain that going back home is the unequivocally correct choice for her. This would imply that she has firmly made up her mind, perhaps after a thorough assessment of her current circumstances in Los Angeles and the opportunities that await her back home, without any lingering doubts or second - thoughts.
(C) This option suggests that the woman, in her contemplation of returning home at 36, is burdened by concerns regarding the perception of others. She might be worried about the judgment or opinions of her peers, family, or the community in general, who may view her return as a sign of failure or lack of independence, given her age and the initial aspiration of starting afresh in Los Angeles.
(D) Here, the focus is on the idea that the woman's consideration of going back home is solely centered around her financial situation. It implies that she sees the offer from her mother as a means to achieve financial stability and that this is the only factor influencing her decision-making process, disregarding any emotional, social, or personal growth-related aspects.

(E). The speaker is expressing concern about Justin’s lack of maturity at the age of 22.
(F). The speaker feels that planning dates is a task better suited for older individuals.",C,"(A). The speaker is essentially admonishing Justin, suggesting that at the relatively young age of 22, he should be brimming with innovative ideas for dates. However, his current state of merely suggesting common activities like going to the movies, having dinner, or taking walks indicates a lack of creativity that seems out of place for someone in his youth.
(B). The humor in this situation stems from the rather unexpected and comical contrast between the typical exuberance, freshness, and creativity often associated with youth and the perceived stagnation that Justin is displaying. It's a humorous juxtaposition because one would generally expect a 22-year-old to be full of novel and exciting ideas, yet Justin appears to be stuck in a rut.
(C). The usage of the term """"stale"""" in this context implies that Justin's relationship of three years has perhaps led to a certain complacency. It's as if the passage of time in this long-term relationship has caused a lack of novelty and creativity in his approach to dates, giving the impression that things have become routine and unexciting.
(D). The speaker is effectively highlighting the irony inherent in associating a sense of stagnation, typically not associated with the early twenties, with Justin. At 22, one is usually at a stage in life where new experiences, exploration, and a plethora of creative ideas are expected, but Justin's behavior defy this norm.
(E). The speaker does not imply that being """"stale"""" is a common trait among people in their 20s. Instead, it's presented as an anomaly for someone of Justin's age. The statement """"You can't be 22 and stale already"""" clearly indicates that the speaker believes Justin's lack of creativity is not representative of his age group.
(F). The underlying message woven throughout this exchange is that creativity should not be circumscribed by age. Just because Justin is 22, it doesn't mean he should be limited to his date-planning ideas. Age should not be a deterrent to coming up with unique, engaging, and creative ways to spend time with his girlfriend.","B,D",en,Which of the following most clearly highlights the unspoken joke in this narrative?,Which of the following most effectively expose the hidden comedic nuances?,194_000000_000102.mp3
